# Daman's Technical Portfolio

I'm a cloud engineer who—figuratively and literally—spends most of my days looking at clouds. A Queens native and **Baruch College (Zicklin School of Business)** alum, I use this repository as a central **hub** for my technical work. 

Here you'll find my personal Azure notes, real-world experiences, scripts, ideas, advice, and shortcuts.
