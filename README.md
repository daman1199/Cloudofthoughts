I'm a cloud engineer who—figuratively and literally—spends most of my days looking at clouds. A Queens native and **Baruch College (Zicklin School of Business)** alum, I build secure Azure infrastructure for financial services.

Here you'll find my Azure notes, real-world experiences, scripts, and shortcuts—focused on security, private networking, and infrastructure that actually works in production.
