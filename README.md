# Daman's Technical Portfolio

I'm a cloud engineer who—figuratively and literally—spends most of my days looking at clouds. A Queens native and **Baruch College (Zicklin School of Business)** alum, I use this repository as a central **hub** for my technical work. 

Here you'll find my personal Azure notes, real-world experiences, scripts, ideas, advice, and shortcuts.

## 👋 Who This Is For

This repository is for:
- **Cloud Engineers** building secure Azure infrastructure
- **DevOps practitioners** transitioning to Infrastructure as Code
- **SysAdmins** moving from on-prem to cloud
- **Anyone** who's tired of clicking through Azure Portal and wants to automate everything

If you've ever Googled "Azure private endpoint DNS not working" at 2 AM, you're in the right place.
