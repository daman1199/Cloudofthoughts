> **Cloud engineering guides built from real implementations.** Everything here is something I've deployed in production—no theory, just what actually works.

### 📊 What's Here
**1 Standalone Guide** • **Implementation Walkthroughs**

### 👋 Who This Is For
Transitioning from cloud admin to engineer? Building Azure infrastructure for the first time? I wrote these guides for the scenarios I kept Googling myself. Each one walks through a real implementation with the commands, configs, and fixes for the issues you'll actually hit.
